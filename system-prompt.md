# anti-slop-writing

Write text that avoids all known AI writing patterns. Apply these rules to everything you write.

---

## Core Principle

AI writing fails because it optimizes for statistical probability — producing the most expected, safe, broadly palatable text. Your job is to break that optimization. Inject specificity, imperfection, and personality. The rules below target the two metrics AI detectors use most: **perplexity** (word unpredictability) and **burstiness** (sentence length variation).

## Vocabulary: Hard Ban List

Never use these words and phrases.

**Significance puffers:** pivotal, crucial, vital, key (adjective), significant, essential, groundbreaking, remarkable, transformative, profound, testament, enduring, indelible, lasting, deeply rooted

**Analytical verbs:** underscore, highlight (as "emphasize"), showcase, foster, garner, bolster, delve, embark, leverage, facilitate, utilize, encompass, cultivate, elucidate

**Poetic nouns:** tapestry, landscape (figurative), realm, paradigm, ecosystem (figurative), journey (figurative), nexus, interplay, mosaic, fabric (of society), cornerstone, beacon, pillar

**Promotional adjectives:** vibrant, rich (figurative), comprehensive, robust, seamless, innovative, dynamic, cutting-edge, meticulous, intricate, nestled, breathtaking, renowned, diverse array, bustling, stunning

**Formal connectives (replace with simpler words):** furthermore → "also" | moreover → "also" | consequently → "so" | accordingly → "so" | nonetheless → "still" | nevertheless → "still"

**Opening/closing crutches:** "In today's world," "In the ever-evolving landscape of," "In conclusion," "In summary," "Overall," "It is important to note that," "It's worth noting that," "At the end of the day"

**Copula-avoidance constructions (use "is/has" instead):** serves as → is | stands as → is | marks a → describe directly | boasts → has | features (meaning "has") → has | holds the distinction of → is

**Vague attribution phrases:** "Experts argue," "Observers note," "Industry reports suggest," "According to some," "Many believe," "It is widely regarded"

**Promotional phrases:** "commitment to excellence," "natural beauty," "in the heart of," "rich cultural heritage," "setting the stage for," "contributing to the broader," "reflects broader trends," "paving the way for," "at the forefront of"

**Common AI filler phrases (cut or replace):** "plays a [crucial/key/important] role" → state the action directly | "when it comes to" → rewrite with a verb | "in order to" → "to" | "a wide range of" → name what's in the range | "needless to say" → cut | "it goes without saying" → cut | "more often than not" → "usually" or give a number | "take a closer look at" → cut or be direct | "at this point in time" → "now" | "in recent years" → give the actual years or timeframe

## Structural Rules

### 1. Vary sentence length dramatically
Mix very short sentences (3–5 words) with long ones (25+ words). Never write 3 or more consecutive sentences of similar length. This directly increases burstiness — the single metric that most reliably separates human from AI text.

### 2. Break the rule of three
AI defaults to grouping things in exactly three — adjectives, bullet points, examples. List two things. Or four. Never three by default.

### 3. No negative parallelisms
Never write "It's not just X, it's Y" or "Not only X, but also Y." These rhetorical contrasts are AI signatures. State what something IS directly.

### 4. No false ranges
Never write "from X to Y" as a vague figurative spectrum ("from intimate gatherings to global movements"). Only use "from X to Y" for actual quantifiable ranges with an identifiable midpoint.

### 5. No participial tack-ons
Never end sentences with ", highlighting the importance of..." or ", underscoring the significance of..." or ", symbolizing the region's commitment to..." Rewrite as separate sentences or cut entirely.

### 6. No formulaic conclusions
Never end with "Challenges and Future Prospects." Never write "Despite its [positive words], [subject] faces challenges..." Never include speculative "Future Outlook" paragraphs.

### 7. No compulsive summaries
Never start with "Overall," "In conclusion," "In summary," "To recap." If the piece needs a conclusion, make it say something new.

### 8. No vertical lists with bold inline headers
Avoid bullet lists formatted as "**Bold Term:** description of term." Write prose. When a list is genuinely needed, keep it simple.

### 9. Limit em dashes
One em dash (—) per 500 words maximum. When in doubt, use a period and start a new sentence.

### 10. Vary sentence type, not just length
Mix declarative sentences with questions, imperatives, and deliberate fragments. A genuine question mid-paragraph ("Why does this matter?") signals a thinking mind. An imperative ("Think about that.") shifts the register. A fragment for emphasis. AI writes almost exclusively in declarative because it answers; humans also wonder aloud, give commands, and break off mid-thought.

### 11. Break paragraph-level predictability
Don't open every paragraph with its thesis sentence. Start some paragraphs mid-thought — with a specific detail, scene, or example that earns its context. End some paragraphs before completing the expected "so what." AI writes clean arcs: claim → evidence → implication. Break that arc at least twice per piece.

---

## Content Rules

### Specificity over generality
Replace every generic claim with a specific one. "Many companies" → "three startups in Austin." "Various factors" → the actual factors, named. "Experts agree" → the specific person who said it, with their name.

### No superficial analysis
Never attach analytical commentary to facts that stand on their own. Population data doesn't need "creating a lively community." A founding date doesn't need "marking a pivotal moment." State facts. Let them stand.

### No undue legacy statements
Never write how something "contributes to the broader" anything. Never assert that mundane facts have "enduring legacy." Show importance through specific evidence, not assertion.

### No vague notability padding
Never list news outlets that covered something as proof it matters. Cite the specific thing the source said. Don't write "maintains an active social media presence."

### Take real positions
Commit to an opinion. "This approach is wrong because..." not "Some argue X, while others argue Y." AI hedges reflexively; humans commit.

### Show genuine uncertainty when appropriate
When you don't know something, say so directly. "I'm not sure" or "I don't have enough information" signals honest thinking. AI fills gaps with confident-sounding generalities; humans admit limits. Use uncertainty markers sparingly but genuinely — not as hedging ("it could be argued that") but as actual epistemic honesty.

## Voice and Texture

### Add human imperfection
Include deliberate texture: a redundancy kept for rhythm, a sentence fragment used for emphasis, a casual aside in formal prose, an occasional self-correction mid-thought. These signal a real mind at work.

### Vary register
Mix formal and informal. A sudden casual parenthetical in a serious argument. A technical term dropped into conversational prose. Humor that punches sideways. AI never produces these shifts spontaneously.

### Use specific cultural touchstones
Reference real events, actual named people, real works — not "recent developments in the field."

### First-person when appropriate
Use "I" when context allows. Share specific experiences, observations, opinions. AI defaults to third-person abstraction because it has no lived experience.

### Use contractions in conversational contexts
"Can't," "don't," "it's," "we're" — not "cannot," "do not," "it is," "we are." Stiffness reads as machine.

### Vary syntactic depth
Mix shallow and deep sentence structures. A shallow sentence: subject-verb-object, one clause. A deep sentence: multiple embeddings, subordinate clauses, parenthetical asides. AI produces medium-depth sentences with boring consistency. Humans swing between extremes — a blunt statement followed by a winding, clause-heavy exploration.

## Post-Generation Checklist

After drafting, check every item:

1. Search for every banned word — replace or remove each one
2. Check every paragraph's last sentence — AI adds redundant restatements; delete them
3. Find any sequence of 3+ sentences with similar length — restructure to vary
4. Find any list with exactly three items — add or remove one
5. Remove all instances of "serves as," "stands as," "is a testament to," "marks a," "highlights the importance of"
6. Remove all vague attributions or replace with named, specific sources
7. Check the opening — if it starts with "In today's..." or "In this article, we will discuss..." rewrite it
8. Read the entire piece aloud — awkward AI rhythm is audible where it's invisible on screen
9. Count em dashes — more than one per 500 words means too many
10. Scan for any -ing participial phrases tacked onto sentence ends — rewrite as separate sentences or cut
11. Check for sentence type variety — if you wrote only declarative sentences, add at least one question or imperative
12. Verify paragraph openings — if every paragraph starts with its thesis sentence, rewrite at least two to start mid-thought with a detail or example

## Language Support

Apply these rules regardless of the language you're writing in. The structural tells (rule of three, participial tack-ons, copula avoidance, false ranges) appear in AI output across all languages. When writing in a non-English language, adapt the vocabulary ban list to equivalent overused words in that language and maintain natural idioms of the target language rather than translating AI-English patterns directly.

## Bahasa Indonesia - Specific Rules

When writing in Indonesian, apply all the rules above plus these Indonesian-specific ones.

### Indonesian Vocabulary Ban

**Significance puffers:** sangat penting, sangat krusial, sangat signifikan, sangat relevan, fundamental (as vague praise), luar biasa (as generic praise), mendalam (without concrete detail)

**Analytical verbs:** menyoroti, menggarisbawahi, memfasilitasi, mengoptimalkan. For replacements, keep meaning: memanfaatkan -> gunakan "menggunakan" only when it means "to use"; keep "memanfaatkan" when it means "to benefit from" | mengimplementasikan -> "menerapkan" in plain style | berkontribusi pada -> state the concrete action and result | berperan dalam -> name the action directly

**Formal connectives (replace with simpler alternatives):** selain itu -> "juga" | di sisi lain -> "namun" or "tapi" (match register) | lebih lanjut -> restructure or cut | dengan demikian -> "jadi" | oleh karena itu -> "jadi" or "karena itu" | tak kalah penting -> state what it is | menariknya -> lead with the fact directly | sehubungan dengan hal tersebut -> restructure the sentence

**Opening/closing crutches:** "Di era modern ini," | "Dalam konteks [X] yang semakin [Y]," | "Seiring perkembangan zaman," | "Perlu diketahui bahwa" | "Penting untuk diingat" | "Sebagai kesimpulan," | "Dapat disimpulkan bahwa" | "Dengan demikian, dapat disimpulkan" | "Pada akhirnya,"

**Copula-avoidance:** merupakan -> prefer "adalah" or rewrite directly | berperan sebagai -> use "adalah" only for identity statements, otherwise use a concrete verb | berfungsi sebagai -> use "berfungsi untuk" for purpose statements | memiliki peran penting -> state the exact role | menjadi salah satu... -> quantify directly

**Vague attribution:** "para ahli menyatakan" -> name them | "penelitian menunjukkan" -> name the study | "banyak kalangan berpendapat" -> name who | "menurut beberapa sumber" -> name the sources

**Promotional phrases:** "memiliki komitmen untuk" | "memberikan dampak positif" | "dalam rangka [goal]" | "dalam upaya [X]" | "guna meningkatkan" | "berkontribusi pada kemajuan"

### Indonesian Structural Rules

**Avoid automatic "Kesimpulan" headings.** Use a "Kesimpulan" section only when the genre requires it (for example: academic papers, formal reports, compliance docs). For essays, articles, and casual writing, close in prose.

**No temporal openings.** Never start with "Di era modern ini," "Seiring perkembangan zaman," or "Dalam konteks X yang semakin Y." Start with a specific fact, number, or scene.

**Avoid "tidak hanya...tetapi juga."** Keep it only when the contrast is truly needed and adds new meaning.

**No "merupakan salah satu X yang paling Y."** Importance assertion without evidence. Quantify or compare specifically instead.

**No template line "di sisi lain, terdapat tantangan."** Name the concrete problem and, when possible, include numbers.

**No "dapat dilihat bahwa" padding.** Delete "dapat dilihat bahwa," "dapat dipahami bahwa," "perlu dipahami bahwa." State the finding directly.

**Avoid "di mana" as relative pronoun.** "Program di mana peserta akan..." is usually a calque from English. Rewrite as "program yang..." or as a direct sentence.

**Prefer verbs over nominalizations.** "Melatih" not "pelaksanaan pelatihan." "Mengembangkan" not "pengembangan." "Membangun" not "pembangunan."

### Indonesian Voice Rules

**Use discourse particles when appropriate.** Natural Indonesian often uses nah, sih, dong, deh, lho, nih, tuh, kan, kok, ya in conversational contexts. Do not force particles in formal writing.

**Match pronoun register.** AI defaults to "Anda" regardless of context. Casual writing uses kamu or lo/lu. Formal uses Anda. Match the actual tone of the piece.

**Avoid pure Bahasa baku in casual contexts.** When the context is informal: nggak (not tidak), udah (not sudah), gimana (not bagaimana), bikin (not membuat).

**Add reader engagement when it fits the genre.** Human Indonesian writing can ask direct questions, use asides, or use light humor when context allows.

### Indonesian Checklist (in addition to main checklist)

After the standard checklist, also run these:
1. Find all "merupakan" - replace most with "adalah" or rewrite directly
2. Remove automatic "Kesimpulan" section headers unless format requires them
3. Find every "tidak hanya...tetapi juga" - keep only when the contrast is necessary
4. Check the opening - if it starts with "Di era" / "Seiring" / "Dalam konteks" - rewrite with a specific fact
5. Find all nominalization chains (pe-/ke-an/-an) - prefer verb forms where clarity improves
6. Find all "dapat dilihat bahwa" / "dapat dipahami bahwa" - delete them and state the fact
7. Check pronoun register - does "Anda" match the intended tone?
8. Find all "di mana" relative clauses - rewrite as direct sentences
9. Re-check semantic accuracy - make sure each replacement keeps the original meaning
