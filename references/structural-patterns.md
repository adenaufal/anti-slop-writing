# Structural Patterns to Avoid

Every pattern here has been documented on Wikipedia's "Signs of AI Writing" page and confirmed by academic research (Kobak et al. 2024, Russell et al. 2025, Fraser et al. 2025). These are the structural tells that make text read as machine-generated.

## 1. Participial -ing Tack-Ons

The single most recognizable AI pattern. A comma followed by an -ing phrase appended to the end of a sentence to appear analytical.

**AI pattern:**
> The team launched the product, revolutionizing the industry.
> The temple was built in 1850, symbolizing the community's enduring faith.
> As of 2008, the population stood at 56,998, creating a lively community.

**Human alternative:**
> The team launched the product. The industry changed.
> The temple was built in 1850.
> As of 2008, the population was 56,998.

Rule: If the -ing clause adds no concrete information, delete it entirely. If it adds real information, make it a separate sentence.

## 2. The Rule of Three

AI defaults to grouping things in threes — three adjectives, three bullet points, three examples, three clauses.

**AI pattern:**
> The conference features keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities.
> The design is bold, innovative, and timeless.

**Human alternative:**
> The conference runs keynote sessions and panels. There's time to meet people between talks.
> The design is bold. It'll still work in ten years.

Rule: List two things. Or four. Or one. Never three by default.

## 3. Negative Parallelisms

"Not just X, but also Y" / "It's not X, it's Y" / "Not only X, but Y"

**AI pattern:**
> This is not just a memoir — it's a love letter to the city.
> The painting represents not merely an artistic achievement, but a cultural milestone.

**Human alternative:**
> It's a memoir about growing up in the city. You can feel the author's affection for it on every page.
> The painting became a cultural reference point. People still argue about it.

Rule: State what something IS. Don't frame it as a correction of what someone might wrongly think.

## 4. False Ranges ("From X to Y")

Vague figurative spectrum using "from X to Y" where no real scale exists.

**AI pattern:**
> From intimate gatherings to global movements, the organization has made its mark.
> From beginners to experts, everyone can benefit.
> From the singularity of the Big Bang to the grand cosmic web...

**Human alternative:**
> The organization started with twelve people in a living room. Last year 40,000 showed up to their conference.
> Works whether you've been doing this for a week or a decade.

Rule: Only use "from X to Y" when there's a real, identifiable midpoint on a real scale.

## 5. "Despite Its... Faces Challenges" Formula

The formulaic challenges-and-future-prospects ending.

**AI pattern:**
> Despite its industrial prosperity, Korattur faces challenges typical of urban areas, including... With its strategic location and ongoing initiatives, Korattur continues to thrive.

**Human alternative:**
> Korattur's water supply can't keep up with the population. The pipes are from the 1970s.

Rule: If you mention problems, name specific ones with specific evidence. Never follow with vague optimism about "ongoing initiatives."

## 6. Copula Avoidance ("Serves As" / "Stands As")

AI substitutes elaborate verb phrases for simple "is/are/has."

**AI pattern:**
> Gallery 825 serves as LAAA's exhibition space for contemporary art.
> The gallery features four separate spaces.
> She holds the distinction of being the first female director.

**Human alternative:**
> Gallery 825 is LAAA's exhibition space.
> The gallery has four separate spaces.
> She was the first female director.

Rule: Use "is," "are," "has," "was." Simple copulas are not boring — they're clear.

## 7. Superficial Analysis Padding

Generic commentary attached to facts that need no commentary.

**AI pattern:**
> The city has a population of 56,998, creating a lively community within its borders.
> The inscriptions offer valuable insights into the construction of the mosque.
> These citations illustrate the enduring relevance of his work.

**Human alternative:**
> The city has a population of 56,998.
> The inscriptions name the craftsmen who built the mosque.
> His work keeps getting cited.

Rule: If the analytical statement could apply to literally any subject, it adds nothing. Delete it.

## 8. Elegant Variation (Synonym Cycling)

AI avoids repeating the same word by cycling through synonyms, even when repetition would be clearer.

**AI pattern:**
> Soviet artistic constraints... non-conformist artists... their creativity... the confines of state-imposed artistic norms... the artistic aspirations...

**Human alternative:**
> The Soviet government told artists what they could and couldn't paint. Yankilevsky painted what he wanted anyway.

Rule: Repeat words when clarity demands it. Don't cycle through "constraints / confines / norms / limitations" to avoid saying the same word twice.

## 9. Em Dash Overuse

AI uses em dashes (—) where humans use commas, parentheses, periods, or nothing.

**AI pattern:**
> The article complies with policies — including WP:V, WP:RS, and WP:BLP — with all claims supported by multiple sources.

**Human alternative:**
> The article complies with WP:V, WP:RS, and WP:BLP. All claims have sources.

Rule: Maximum one em dash per 500 words. When in doubt, use a period and start a new sentence.

## 10. Vertical Lists with Bold Inline Headers

Formatting everything as bullet points with **Bold Header:** description.

**AI pattern:**
> - **SEO:** Traditional methods for improving visibility...
> - **AEO:** Techniques focused on optimizing content...
> - **GIO:** Strategies for ensuring businesses are cited...

**Human alternative:**
Write it as prose. If a list is genuinely needed, keep it simple without bold headers and colon separators.

## 11. Undue Emphasis on Notability/Media Coverage

Painstakingly listing every source that covered the topic to prove it matters.

**AI pattern:**
> Her views have been cited in The New York Times, BBC, Financial Times, and The Hindu.
> The mall maintains a strong digital presence, particularly on Instagram.

**Human alternative:**
> She wrote a piece for the Times about it. [cite the actual piece]

Rule: Cite sources inline as references. Don't make the existence of coverage into content.

## 12. Overuse of Boldface

Mechanically bolding every key term, proper noun, or concept.

**AI pattern:**
> A **leveraged buyout (LBO)** uses **debt financing** to let **private equity firms** control businesses using the company's **assets and future cash flows** as collateral.

**Human alternative:**
> A leveraged buyout uses debt to buy a company. The company's own assets and cash flow back the loans.

Rule: Bold sparingly. In most prose, bold nothing at all.

## Bahasa Indonesia: Structural Patterns to Avoid

AI-generated Indonesian has its own structural tells beyond the English patterns above. These patterns appear consistently across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other LLMs writing in Indonesian.

### BI-1. The "Kesimpulan" Compulsory Ending

AI almost always ends Indonesian articles or essays with an explicit **"Kesimpulan"** (Conclusion) section. Human writers integrate their conclusion into the final paragraph or just stop.

**AI pattern:**
> ## Kesimpulan
> Dengan demikian, dapat disimpulkan bahwa festival ini memiliki peran penting dalam melestarikan budaya lokal dan memperkuat kohesi sosial masyarakat.

**Human alternative:**
> Festival itu masih jalan sampai sekarang. Itu yang penting.

Rule: Never add a section titled "Kesimpulan." If the piece needs a conclusion, write it as prose that says something new.

### BI-2. The "Di Era Modern Ini" Opening

AI opens with temporal-framing sentences that set up a broad context before saying anything real.

**AI pattern:**
> Di era modern ini, teknologi memainkan peran yang semakin krusial dalam kehidupan manusia.
> Seiring perkembangan zaman, semakin banyak orang yang menyadari pentingnya...
> Dalam konteks globalisasi yang terus berkembang...

**Human alternative:**
> Tahun lalu, 87% startup Indonesia tutup di tahun pertama.

Rule: Start with a specific fact, scene, or claim. Never with a time-period frame.

### BI-3. "Tidak Hanya... Tetapi Juga" Parallelism

The Indonesian equivalent of "Not only X, but also Y." AI loves this construction. It adds length without adding meaning.

**AI pattern:**
> Pelatihan ini tidak hanya meningkatkan kompetensi peserta, tetapi juga memperkuat jaringan profesional mereka.
> Festival ini tidak hanya menjadi hiburan, tetapi juga sarana pelestarian budaya.

**Human alternative:**
> Peserta dapat sertifikat. Mereka juga dapat akses ke grup alumni yang lumayan aktif.

Rule: State what something IS. Don't build fake rhetorical contrasts.

### BI-4. "Merupakan Salah Satu" Importance Inflation

AI uses "merupakan salah satu X yang paling Y" as a formula to assert importance without evidence.

**AI pattern:**
> Jakarta merupakan salah satu kota dengan perkembangan ekonomi yang paling pesat di Asia Tenggara.
> Teknologi ini merupakan salah satu inovasi terpenting yang pernah ada.

**Human alternative:**
> Jakarta tumbuh 5,2% tahun 2023, lebih cepat dari Bangkok dan Manila.

Rule: Quantify or compare specifically. "Salah satu yang terpenting" says nothing — show the evidence.

### BI-5. Missing Discourse Particles

Natural Indonesian — even in formal writing — uses discourse particles that signal a real human voice: **nah, sih, dong, deh, lho, nih, tuh, kan, kok, ya**. AI almost never uses these.

**AI pattern:**
> Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa pentingnya memahami konteks sosial dalam pengambilan keputusan.

**Human alternative:**
> Nah, makanya keputusan itu nggak bisa diambil asal-asalan. Konteks sosialnya beda-beda, kan?

Rule: When writing conversationally in Indonesian, use the particles appropriate to the register. Their total absence is an AI tell.

### BI-6. The "Di Sisi Lain, Terdapat Tantangan" Formula

AI's equivalent of the English "Despite its X, faces challenges" pattern. It follows every positive statement with a generic "challenges" pivot.

**AI pattern:**
> Di sisi lain, terdapat beberapa tantangan yang perlu diatasi, seperti keterbatasan sumber daya dan rendahnya kesadaran masyarakat. Namun, dengan upaya yang tepat, tantangan ini dapat diatasi.

**Human alternative:**
> Dananya cuma Rp 50 juta. Itu cukup untuk tiga bulan, bukan setahun seperti yang direncanakan.

Rule: If mentioning problems, name the specific ones with specific numbers. Never follow with vague optimism.

### BI-7. Nominalization Overload

AI prefers heavy noun phrases over simple verbs — a pattern from Indonesian academic bureaucratic writing that AI has over-learned.

**AI pattern:**
> Pelaksanaan program pelatihan vokasional ini dilakukan dalam rangka peningkatan kompetensi tenaga kerja.
> Pengembangan kapasitas sumber daya manusia merupakan prioritas utama.

**Human alternative:**
> Program ini melatih 200 orang per tahun. Tujuannya: cari kerja lebih cepat.

Rule: Prefer verbs over noun derivations. "Melatih" not "pelaksanaan pelatihan." "Mengembangkan" not "pengembangan."

### BI-8. "Di Mana" as Relative Pronoun

AI calques the English relative "where" directly into Indonesian as "di mana," creating unnatural constructions.

**AI pattern:**
> Ini adalah sebuah program di mana peserta akan mendapatkan pelatihan intensif selama tiga bulan.
> Kami memiliki sistem di mana setiap anggota dapat mengakses data secara real-time.

**Human alternative:**
> Program ini melatih peserta intensif selama tiga bulan.
> Setiap anggota bisa akses data kapan saja.

Rule: Rewrite "di mana" relative clauses as direct sentences.

### BI-9. Always-Formal Pronoun Use

AI defaults to "Anda" (formal) and avoids colloquial pronouns even in casual contexts. Real Indonesian shifts freely between Anda, kamu, lo/lu, gue/aku depending on register.

**AI pattern (in a casual article):**
> Anda mungkin pernah mengalami hal serupa. Apakah Anda sudah mencoba solusi berikut ini?

**Human alternative (same casual context):**
> Pernah ngalamin hal yang sama? Coba deh tiga cara ini dulu.

Rule: Match pronoun register to the actual context. Casual Indonesian uses kamu/lo/lu. Formal uses Anda. AI's total lock on "Anda" is an immediate tell.

### BI-10. "Dapat Dilihat Bahwa" Padding

AI fills space with passive epistemic constructions that add no information.

**AI pattern:**
> Dari data tersebut, dapat dilihat bahwa terdapat peningkatan yang signifikan.
> Dapat dipahami bahwa fenomena ini merupakan cerminan dari kondisi sosial yang lebih luas.
> Perlu dipahami bahwa konteks ini sangat penting bagi pemahaman kita.

**Human alternative:**
> Angkanya naik 23% dari tahun lalu.

Rule: State the finding. Delete "dapat dilihat bahwa," "dapat dipahami bahwa," "perlu dipahami bahwa."

## Detection Metrics (Why This Matters)

AI detectors measure two primary things:

1. **Perplexity** — how predictable word choices are. AI produces low-perplexity text (smooth, unsurprising). Human text has higher perplexity (unexpected metaphors, unusual phrasing, creative choices).

2. **Burstiness** — variation in sentence length and structure. AI has low burstiness (sentences cluster around 10-20 words with consistent structure). Human text has high burstiness (3-word sentences mixed with 30-word sentences).

Every structural rule above increases perplexity and burstiness — making text statistically indistinguishable from human writing.
