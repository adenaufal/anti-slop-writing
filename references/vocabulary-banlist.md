## Replacement Strategy

When you encounter a banned word, don't just swap it for a synonym. Restructure the sentence to say what you actually mean in plain language.

**Before:** "The festival serves as a vibrant testament to the region's rich cultural heritage, showcasing the intricate tapestry of traditions."

**After:** "The festival has been running since 1987. Locals sell handmade pottery and goat cheese from stalls they build themselves each spring."

The fix is never finding a better adjective. The fix is replacing vague praise with specific facts.
