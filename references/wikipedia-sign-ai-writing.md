LLMs tend to have an identifiable writing style.

This is a list of writing and formatting conventions typical of [AI chatbots](/wiki/AI_chatbot "AI chatbot") such as [ChatGPT](/wiki/ChatGPT "ChatGPT"), with real examples taken from Wikipedia articles and drafts. It is a [field guide](/wiki/Field_guide "Field guide") to help detect [undisclosed AI-generated content](/wiki/Wikipedia:LLMDISCLOSE "Wikipedia:LLMDISCLOSE") _on Wikipedia_: while some of the signs may be broadly applicable, some may not apply in a non-Wikipedia context.[\[a\]](#cite_note-1) Not all text featuring these indicators is AI-generated, as the [large language models](/wiki/Large_language_model "Large language model") that power AI chatbots are trained on human writing, including Wikipedia.

Moreover, this list is _descriptive_, not _prescriptive_; it consists of observations, not rules. Advice about formatting or language to avoid can be found in the [policies and guidelines](/wiki/Wikipedia:PAG "Wikipedia:PAG") and the [Manual of Style](/wiki/Wikipedia:MOS "Wikipedia:MOS"), but does not belong on this page.

The patterns here are also only potential _signs_ of a problem, not _the problem itself_. While many of these issues are immediately obvious and easy to fix—e.g., excessive boldface, broken markup, citation style quirks—they can point to less outwardly visible problems that carry [much more serious policy risks](/wiki/Wikipedia:AIFAIL "Wikipedia:AIFAIL"). Please do not merely treat these signs as the problems to be fixed; that could just make detection harder. The actual problems are those deeper concerns, so make sure to address them, either yourself or by flagging them, per the advice at [Wikipedia:Large language models § Handling suspected LLM-generated content](/wiki/Wikipedia:Large_language_models#Handling_suspected_LLM-generated_content "Wikipedia:Large language models") and [Wikipedia:WikiProject AI Cleanup/Guide](/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_AI_Cleanup/Guide "Wikipedia:WikiProject AI Cleanup/Guide").

The [speedy deletion policy](/wiki/Wikipedia:Speedy_deletion "Wikipedia:Speedy deletion") criterion [G15](/wiki/Wikipedia:G15 "Wikipedia:G15") (LLM-generated pages without human review) lists some signs of AI writing, but is limited to the most objective ones. The remaining signs covered here are not sufficient on their own for speedy deletion.

## Caveats

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Caveats")\]

### AI detection tools

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: AI detection tools")\]

Do not solely rely on [artificial intelligence content detection](/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_content_detection "Artificial intelligence content detection") tools (such as [GPTZero](/wiki/GPTZero "GPTZero")). While they perform better than random chance, these tools have non-trivial error rates.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Russell-2) Detectors can be susceptible to factors such as text modifications (e.g. paraphrasing and spacing changes) and the use of models not seen during detector training.[\[2\]](#cite_note-3)

### Your detection ability

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Your detection ability")\]

Do not rely too much on your own judgment. While research on humans' abilities to detect AI-generated text is limited, a 2025 preprint shows that heavy users of LLMs can correctly determine whether an article was generated by AI about 90% of the time, which means that if you are an expert user of LLMs and you tag 10 pages as being AI-generated, you've probably made one false positive. People who don't use LLMs much do only slightly better than random chance (in both directions).[\[1\]](#cite_note-Russell-2)

## Content

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Content")\]

[Shortcuts](/wiki/Wikipedia:Shortcut "Wikipedia:Shortcut")

LLMs (and [artificial neural networks](/wiki/Artificial_neural_network "Artificial neural network") in general) use statistical algorithms to guess (infer) what should come next based on a large corpus of training material. It thus tends to [regress to the mean](/wiki/Regression_to_the_mean "Regression to the mean"); that is, the result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases. It can simultaneously be a strength and a "tell" for detecting AI-generated content.

For example, LLMs are usually trained on data from the internet in which famous people are generally described with positive, important-sounding language. Consequently, the LLM tends to omit specific, unusual, nuanced facts (which are statistically rare) and replace them with more generic, positive descriptions (which are statistically common). Thus the highly specific "inventor of the first train-coupling device" might become "a revolutionary titan of industry". It is like shouting louder and louder that a portrait shows a uniquely important person, while the portrait itself is fading from a sharp photograph into a blurry, generic sketch. The subject becomes simultaneously less specific and more exaggerated.[\[b\]](#cite_note-4)

This statistical regression to the mean, a smoothing over of specific facts into generic statements, that could equally apply to many topics, makes AI-generated content easier to detect.

Moreover, each model and version of AI chatbots have a distinctive way of writing ([idiolect](/wiki/Idiolect "Idiolect")),[\[3\]](#cite_note-rud-5) so that what is typical for ChatGPT-4 might not be characteristic to Gemini.

### Undue emphasis on significance, legacy, and broader trends

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Undue emphasis on significance, legacy, and broader trends")\]

Words to watch: **_stands/serves as_, _is a testament/reminder_, _a vital/significant/crucial/pivotal/key role/moment_, _underscores/highlights its importance/significance_, _reflects broader_, _symbolizing its ongoing/enduring/lasting_, _contributing to the_, _setting the stage for_, _marking/shaping the_, _represents/marks a shift_, _key turning point_, _evolving landscape_, _focal point_, _indelible mark_, _deeply rooted_,  ...**

LLM writing often [puffs up](/wiki/Wikipedia:Puffery "Wikipedia:Puffery") the importance of the subject matter by adding statements about how arbitrary aspects of the topic represent or contribute to a broader topic.[\[4\]](#cite_note-chronicle-6) There is a distinct and easily identifiable repertoire of ways that it writes these statements.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Juzek-7)

> The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was officially established in 1989, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of regional statistics in Spain. \[...\]
> 
> The founding of Idescat represented a significant shift toward regional statistical independence, enabling [Catalonia](/wiki/Catalonia "Catalonia") to develop a statistical system tailored to its unique socio-economic context. This initiative was part of a broader movement across Spain to decentralize administrative functions and enhance regional governance.

> Kumba has long been an important center for trade and agriculture. \[...\] The establishment of road networks connecting Kumba to other parts of the Southwest Region, such as Mamfe and Buea, helped solidify its role as a regional hub.

— From [this revision](/wiki/Special:Diff/1248482444 "Special:Diff/1248482444") to [Kumba, Cameroon](/wiki/Kumba,_Cameroon "Kumba, Cameroon")

LLMs may include these statements for even the most mundane of subjects like etymology or population data. Sometimes, they add hedging preambles acknowledging that the subject is relatively unimportant or low-profile, before talking about its importance anyway.

**Examples**

> During the [Spanish colonial period](/wiki/Spanish_Colonial_Period_\(Philippines\) "Spanish Colonial Period (Philippines)"), the name _Bakunutan_ was hispanized to _Bacnotan_, a modification reflected in official documents preserved in the [National Archives](/wiki/National_Archives_of_the_Philippines "National Archives of the Philippines") in Manila. This etymology highlights the enduring legacy of the community's resistance and the transformative power of unity in shaping its identity.

— From [this revision](/wiki/Special:Diff/1265870147 "Special:Diff/1265870147") to [Bacnotan](/wiki/Bacnotan "Bacnotan")

> Though it saw only limited application, it contributes to the broader history of early aviation engineering and reflects the influence of French rotary designs on German manufacturers.

— From [Draft:Goebel Goe II](/wiki/Draft:Goebel_Goe_II "Draft:Goebel Goe II")

When talking about biology (e.g., when asked to discuss an animal or plant species), LLMs tend to over-emphasize connections to the broader ecosystem or environment, even when those connections are tenuous or generic. LLMs also tend to belabor the species' conservation status and research and preservation efforts, even if the status is unknown and no serious efforts exist.

**Examples**

> It plays a role in the ecosystem and contributes to Hawaii's rich cultural heritage. \[...\] Preserving this endemic species is vital not only for ecological diversity but also for sustaining the cultural traditions connected to Hawaii’s native flora.

— From [this revision](/wiki/Special:Diff/1262033910 "Special:Diff/1262033910") to [Nototrichium divaricatum](/wiki/Nototrichium_divaricatum "Nototrichium divaricatum")

> Currently, there is no specific conservation assessment for _Lethrinops lethrinus_ by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, the general health of the Lake Malawi ecosystem is crucial for the survival of this and other endemic species. Factors such as overfishing, pollution, and habitat destruction could potentially impact their populations.

— From [this revision](/wiki/Special:Diff/1235454313 "Special:Diff/1235454313") to [Lethrinops lethrinus](/wiki/Lethrinops_lethrinus "Lethrinops lethrinus")

### Undue emphasis on notability, attribution, and media coverage

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Undue emphasis on notability, attribution, and media coverage")\]

[Shortcuts](/wiki/Wikipedia:Shortcut "Wikipedia:Shortcut")

-   [WP:OVERATTRIBUTION](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:OVERATTRIBUTION&redirect=no)[WP:OVERATTRIBUTION](/wiki/Wikipedia:OVERATTRIBUTION "Wikipedia:OVERATTRIBUTION")
-   [WP:AIATTR](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:AIATTR&redirect=no)[WP:AIATTR](/wiki/Wikipedia:AIATTR "Wikipedia:AIATTR")

Words to watch: **_independent coverage_, _local/regional/national/\[country name\] media outlets_, _music/business/tech outlets_, _profiled in_, _written by a leading expert_, _active social media presence_**

Similarly, LLMs act as if the best way to prove that a subject is notable is to hit readers over the head with claims of notability, often by listing sources that a subject has been covered in. They may or may not provide additional context as to what those sources have actually said about the subject, and often inaccurately attribute their own [superficial analyses](#Superficial_analyses) to the source. This is more common in text from newer AI tools (2025 or later).

Human-written press releases have of course also cited news clippings for decades, but LLMs specifically asked to write a Wikipedia article often echo the exact wording of [Wikipedia's guidelines](/wiki/Wikipedia:N "Wikipedia:N"), such as "independent coverage."

**Examples**

> She spoke about AI on CNN, and was featured in Vogue, Wired, Toronto Star, and other media. \[...\] Her insights have also been featured in \*Wired\*, \*Refinery29\*, and other prominent media outlets.

— From [this revision](/wiki/Special:Diff/1276225083 "Special:Diff/1276225083") to [Sinead Bovell](/wiki/Sinead_Bovell "Sinead Bovell") (also note the [use](#Use_of_Markdown) of [Markdown](/wiki/Markdown "Markdown"))

> Her views have been cited in _The New York Times_, _BBC_, _Financial Times_, and _The Hindu_.

— From [this revision](/wiki/Special:Diff/1285114966 "Special:Diff/1285114966") to [Shamika Ravi](/wiki/Shamika_Ravi "Shamika Ravi")

> Its significance is documented in archived school event programs and regional press coverage, including the \*Mesabi Daily News\*, which regularly reviewed performances held there.

— From [this revision](/wiki/Special:Diff/1294930957 "Special:Diff/1294930957") to [Virginia High School (Minnesota)](/wiki/Virginia_High_School_\(Minnesota\) "Virginia High School (Minnesota)") (also note the [use](#Use_of_Markdown) of [Markdown](/wiki/Markdown "Markdown"))

On Wikipedia specifically, LLMs often painstakingly emphasize their sources in the body text—even for trivial coverage, uncontroversial facts, or other situations where a human Wikipedia editor would be more likely to either provide an inline citation or no source at all.

**Examples**

> The restaurant has also been mentioned in [ABC News](/wiki/ABC_News_\(Australia\) "ABC News (Australia)") coverage relating to incidents in the surrounding precinct, underscoring its role as a well-known late-night venue in the city \[of [Adelaide](/wiki/Adelaide "Adelaide")\].

— Trivial coverage with attribution, from [this revision](/wiki/Special:PermanentLink/1305163154 "Special:PermanentLink/1305163154") of [The Original Pancake Kitchen](/wiki/The_Original_Pancake_Kitchen "The Original Pancake Kitchen"); the reference added for this sentence did not exist.

> In the United States, university-based incubators and accelerators have expanded alongside these centers; an official Library of Congress review found that 31.5% of SBA \[[Small Business Administration](/wiki/Small_Business_Administration "Small Business Administration")\] Growth Accelerator Fund Competition winners from 2014–2016 were university-based programs.

— Attribution of uncontroversial information, from [this revision](/wiki/Special:PermanentLink/1317019290 "Special:PermanentLink/1317019290") of [Entrepreneurship education](/wiki/Entrepreneurship_education "Entrepreneurship education")

In articles about people/entities who use social media, LLMs will often note that they "maintain an active social media presence" or something similar. This wording is particularly idiosyncratic to AI text and relatively uncommon on Wikipedia before ~2024.

> The mall maintains a strong digital presence, particularly on Instagram, where it actively shares the latest updates and events. Forum Kochi has consistently demonstrated excellence in digital promotions, with high-quality, engaging, and impactful video content playing a key role in its outreach.

— From [this revision](/wiki/Special:Diff/1297291381 "Special:Diff/1297291381") to [Forum Mall Kochi](/wiki/Forum_Mall_Kochi "Forum Mall Kochi")

In some cases, LLMs will create entire sections to assert notability, with a breakdown of the sources that have covered the topic in a list format. This is in contrast to how most articles are written — summarizing the content that sources publish, then citing them as footnotes.

**Examples**

> Media coverage
> 
> -   \*\*IRNA\*\* – Coverage of his inter-city marathon events.
> -   \*\*ISNA\*\* – Report on an 80 km provincial peace run.
> -   \*\*IFRC\*\* – Feature on his humanitarian campaigns.
> -   \*\*Fars News\*\* – Interview on his national running projects.
> -   \*\*Varzesh3\*\* – Report on a 17-day endurance run.
> -   \*\*Borna News\*\* – Profile on his athletic background.

### Superficial analyses

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Superficial analyses")\]

[Shortcut](/wiki/Wikipedia:Shortcut "Wikipedia:Shortcut")

-   [WP:SUPERFICIAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:SUPERFICIAL&redirect=no)[WP:SUPERFICIAL](/wiki/Wikipedia:SUPERFICIAL "Wikipedia:SUPERFICIAL")

Words to watch: **_highlighting/underscoring/emphasizing ..._, _ensuring ..._, _reflecting/symbolizing ..._, _contributing to ..._, _cultivating/fostering ..._ (in the figurative sense), _encompassing ..._, _valuable insights_, _align/resonate with_,**

AI chatbots tend to insert superficial analysis of information, often in relation to its significance, recognition, or impact.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Reinhart-8) This is often done by attaching a [present participle](/wiki/Participle#Forms "Participle") ("-ing") phrase at the end of sentences, sometimes with [vague attributions](/wiki/Wikipedia:AIWEASEL "Wikipedia:AIWEASEL") to third parties (see below).[\[6\]](#cite_note-Reinhart-8)[\[4\]](#cite_note-chronicle-6)

For the purpose of Wikipedia, such comments are usually [synthesis](/wiki/Wikipedia:SYNTH "Wikipedia:SYNTH") and/or unattributed opinions. Newer chatbots with [retrieval-augmented generation](/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation "Retrieval-augmented generation") (for example, an AI chatbot that can search the web) may attach these statements to [named sources](#Undue_emphasis_on_notability,_attribution,_and_media_coverage)—e.g., "Roger Ebert highlighted the lasting influence"—regardless of whether those sources say anything close.

**Examples**

> As of the April 2008 census, the population of Douera stood at approximately 56,998 inhabitants, creating a lively community within its borders. Situated in the central-north region of the country, Douera enjoys close proximity to the capital city, Algiers, further enhancing its significance as a dynamic hub of activity and culture. With its coastal charm and convenient location, Douera captivates both residents and visitors alike, offering a diverse range of experiences against the backdrop of Algeria's stunning natural beauty.

> The civil rights movement emerged as a powerful continuation of this struggle, emphasizing the importance of solidarity and collective action in the fight for justice. This historical legacy has influenced contemporary African-American families, shaping their values, community structures, and approaches to political engagement. Economically, the enduring impacts of systemic inequality have led to both challenges and innovations within African-American communities, driving a commitment to empowerment and social change that echoes through generations.

> Situated just a few miles from the U.S.-Mexico border—a line that often represents separation and division—the temple stands as a counter-symbol, emphasizing unity, togetherness, and transcendent faith. In a region where many families and communities span both countries, the temple fosters a sense of connection and shared purpose. Through its inclusive design and symbolic features, the McAllen Texas Temple is seen as a bridge across divides, embodying the spirit of unity that underlies its sacred purpose. Its bilingual monument sign, with inscriptions in both English and Spanish, underscores its role in bringing together Latter-day Saints from the United States and Mexico.
> 
> The temple’s architectural and decorative elements are thoughtfully imbued with local symbolism, reflecting the rich culture and landscape of the Rio Grande Valley. Citrus blossom motifs, seen throughout the exterior and interior, celebrate the area’s agricultural roots and its vital citrus industry. The temple’s color palette of blue, green, and gold resonates with the region’s natural beauty, symbolizing Texas bluebonnets, the Gulf of Mexico, and the diverse Texan landscapes. These colors and patterns evoke enduring faith and resilience, qualities that resonate deeply within this close-knit, cross-border community.
> 
> In design and structure, the McAllen Texas Temple honors the Spanish colonial heritage that has historically shaped the area. By incorporating these architectural elements, the temple connects to both the Latin American influences and the historic roots of the border region, creating a space where the past and present come together.

LLMs have serious problems keeping a neutral tone. Even when prompted to use an encyclopedic tone, and even when editors have no [promotional interest](/wiki/Wikipedia:COI "Wikipedia:COI") in a topic, their output will often tend toward advertisement-like writing. This may happen when generating new text or rewriting existing text; they often insert promotional language while claiming they removed it.

Note: Not all promotional or spammy writing is AI-generated. LLMs tend to over-use the same set of promotional phrases no matter what the topic. Also, older LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) tend to output more blatantly positive text than newer LLMs, which are more likely to be subtly positive.

#### Subtypes

When writing about something that could be considered "cultural heritage," LLMs [constantly remind the reader of its importance](#Undue_emphasis_on_significance,_legacy,_and_broader_trends).

> Nestled within the breathtaking region of Gonder in Ethiopia, Alamata Raya Kobo stands as a vibrant town with a rich cultural heritage and a significant place within the Amhara region. From its scenic landscapes to its historical landmarks, Alamata Raya Kobo offers visitors a fascinating glimpse into the diverse tapestry of Ethiopia. In this article, we will explore the unique characteristics that make Alamata Raya Kobo a town worth visiting and shed light on its significance within the Amhara region.

Its low, elongated silhouette is highlighted by a wide stance and an extended coupe door, which enhances accessibility to the spacious rear cabin. Smooth, uninterrupted surfaces and a pronounced A-line accentuate the vehicle’s overall length, while a sleek, low tail imparts a sense of refined dynamism. A mid-body line runs seamlessly from the headlamps to the taillights, reinforcing the car’s cohesive and elegant design. Traditional door handles have been replaced with discrete buttons, preserving the vehicle’s clean and modern profile. In a nod to Cadillac’s legacy of bold color choices, the exterior is finished in "Manila Cream"—a distinctive hue originally offered in 1957 and 1958. This heritage color has been thoughtfully revived and hand-painted by Cadillac artisans, showcasing the brand’s dedication to craftsmanship and historical reverence.

### Vague attributions and overgeneralization of opinions

Words to watch: **_Industry reports_, _Observers have cited_, _Experts argue_, _Some critics argue_, _several sources/publications_ (when only few sources are cited), _such as_ (before exhaustive word lists),  ...**

AI chatbots tend to attribute opinions or claims to some vague authority—a practice called [weasel wording](/wiki/Weasel_wording "Weasel wording").

**Examples**

Because much of the historical record derives from [Hausa](/wiki/Hausa "Hausa") chronicles, Bornu sources and oral tradition, modern researchers treat Kwararafa as a fluid political and cultural formation rather than a fixed state.

AI chatbots also commonly exaggerate the quantity of sources that these opinions are attributed to. They may present views from one or two sources as widely held (often combined with the vague attributions above), mention the existence or opinion of multiple "reviewers" or "scholars" while only citing one person, or imply that lists of examples are non-exhaustive when the sources give no indication that other examples exist.

### Outline-like conclusions about challenges and future prospects

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Outline-like conclusions about challenges and future prospects")\]

Words to watch: **_Despite its... faces several challenges..._, _Despite these challenges_, _Challenges and Legacy_, _Future Outlook_ ...**

Many LLM-generated Wikipedia articles include a "Challenges" section, which typically begins with a sentence like "Despite its \[positive/promotional words\], \[article subject\] faces challenges..." and ends with either a vaguely positive assessment of the article subject,[\[1\]](#cite_note-Russell-2) or speculation about how ongoing or potential initiatives could benefit the subject. Such paragraphs usually appear at the end of articles with a rigid outline structure, which may also include a separate section for "Future Prospects."

Note: This sign is about the rigid formula, not simply the mention of challenges or challenging.

### Leads treating Wikipedia lists or broad article titles as proper nouns

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Leads treating Wikipedia lists or broad article titles as proper nouns")\]

In AI-generated articles about topics with a title that is not a [proper name](/wiki/Proper_name "Proper name"), such as a [list](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Lists "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lists"), the first sentence of the lead may introduce and/or define the article's title as if it were a standalone real-world entity. While the [MOS](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Lead_section#Format_of_the_first_sentence "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section") does allow such titles to be included at the beginning of the lead "in a natural way," these AI leads tend not to be so natural.

### Vague see also sections

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Vague see also sections")\]

LLMs tend to fill _see also_ sections with broad terms. For example, a see also section on a article about a startup may link to [Financial technology](/wiki/Financial_technology "Financial technology"). Such entries may link to non-existent articles or be unlinked altogether.

Many studies have demonstrated that LLMs overuse specific words. These words started appearing far more frequently in text produced after 2022, when LLM chatbots became widely accessible, than similar text produced beforehand.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Juzek-7)[\[8\]](#cite_note-Kobak-14) These words often co-occur in LLM output: where there is one, there are likely others.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Kousha-17) While most of these studies have analyzed scientific abstracts or fiction, "AI vocabulary" words are also ubiquitous in LLM-based encyclopedias, such as [Grokipedia](/wiki/Grokipedia "Grokipedia"), and in AI-generated Wikipedia text. One or two of these words appearing in an edit may be coincidental, but an edit (post-2022) introducing lots of them, lots of times, is one of the strongest tells for AI use.

The distribution of "AI vocabulary" is slightly different depending on which chatbot or LLM was used,[\[6\]](#cite_note-Reinhart-8) and has changed over time. For instance, the word _delve_ was famously overused by ChatGPT in 2023 and early 2024, but became less frequent later in 2024, then dropped off sharply in 2025.[\[12\]](#cite_note-merrill-18)[\[7\]](#cite_note-geng-13) Below is a breakdown of which words frequently recur together during which "era" of LLMs, to help you more quickly track down when AI text was added. While these are _not_ hard cutoffs, they should give you a rough idea of what "earlier" vs "later" LLM output reads like.

-   **2023 to mid-2024** (GPT-4): _Additionally_, _boasts_, _bolstered_, _crucial_, _delve_, _emphasizing_, _enduring_, _garner_, _intricate/intricacies_, _interplay_, _key_, _landscape_, _meticulous/meticulously_, _pivotal_, _underscore_, _tapestry_, _testament_, _valuable_, _vibrant_
-   **Mid-2024 to mid-2025** (GPT-4o): _align with_, _bolstered_, _crucial_, _emphasizing_, _enhance_, _enduring_, _fostering_, _highlighting_, _pivotal_, _showcasing_, _underscore_, _vibrant_
-   **Mid-2025 and on** (GPT-5): _emphasizing_, _enhance_, _highlighting_, _showcasing_ (plus words associated with ["Undue emphasis on notability, attribution, and media coverage"](#Undue_emphasis_on_notability,_attribution,_and_media_coverage))

Please keep context in mind. For example, while the figurative use of "underscore" is ubiquitous in earlier AI text, the word can also refer to a literal underline mark or to [incidental music](/wiki/Incidental_music "Incidental music").

These names highlight the collaborative nature of mosque construction and emphasize the contributions of skilled artisans. \[...\] For example, the repeated invocation of the names of Muhammad and the Twelve Imams in Kufic script highlights the Shi'ite character of the mosque and links its construction to the broader context of the Ilkhanid state's official adoption of Shi'ism under [Oljeitu](/wiki/%C3%96ljait%C3%BC "Öljaitü"). \[...\] This inscription, commissioned during the reign of the Aq Qoyunlu ruler Uzun Hasan, also underscores the enduring practice of pious patronage for mosque upkeep and renovation.

### Avoidance of basic copulatives ("is"/"are" phrases)

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Avoidance of basic copulatives (\"is\"/\"are\" phrases)")\]

Words to watch: **_serves as/stands as/marks/represents \[a\]_, _boasts/features/offers \[a\]_**

LLM-generated text often substitutes constructions like _serves as a_ or _mark the_ for their simpler counterparts that use [copulas](/wiki/Copula_\(linguistics\) "Copula (linguistics)") such as _is_ or _are_. One study documented an over 10% decrease in the usage of the words _is_ and _are_ in academic writing in 2023, with no major changes in their frequency before that.[\[13\]](#cite_note-geng2-19) Similarly, it prefers phrases with _features_, _offers_, and the like to their more neutral counterparts with _has_. Sometimes these constructions are more elaborate, e.g., _ventured into politics as a candidate_ versus _was a candidate_.

This is particularly visible in AI copyedits, which will often "improve" text in this way. The study above also demonstrated that when GPT-3.5 was prompted to "Revise the following sentence" in 10,000 abstracts, the words _is_ and _are_ appeared less often in the revised versions.[\[13\]](#cite_note-geng2-19)

Note: This sign does not apply to Wikipedia leads (of the form "\[Article subject\] is..."); since LLMs are trained in part on Wikipedia, they have plenty of examples of leads to emulate.

When LLMs describe a subject, they often write as though their output's hypothetical audience may be reaching an incomplete or incorrect conclusion about that subject, and they are trying to retroactively challenge such thinking by pointing out another characteristic that the subject may possess alongside (or in the place of) one or more previously-mentioned characteristics.

#### Not just X, but also Y

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Not just X, but also Y")\]

It is common for LLMs to use parallel constructions involving "not", "but", or "however" such as "Not only ... but ..." or "It is not just about ..., it's ..." in an attempt to appear balanced and thoughtful.[\[14\]](#cite_note-20)[\[1\]](#cite_note-Russell-2)[\[12\]](#cite_note-merrill-18)

**Examples**

Another common LLM pattern is parallelisms that explicitly state that a particular item doesn't possess the first characteristic at all. Such constructions are often expressed as "It's not ..., it's ..." or "no ..., no ..., just ...".[\[10\]](#cite_note-Kriss-16)

LLMs overuse the '[rule of three](/wiki/Rule_of_three_\(writing\) "Rule of three (writing)")'. This can take different forms, from "adjective, adjective, adjective" to "short phrase, short phrase, and short phrase".[\[1\]](#cite_note-Russell-2)[\[10\]](#cite_note-Kriss-16) LLMs often use this structure to make [superficial analyses](#Superficial_analyses) appear more comprehensive.

Generative AI has a repetition-penalty code, meant to discourage it from reusing words too often.[\[4\]](#cite_note-chronicle-6) For instance, the output might give a main character's name and then repeatedly use a different synonym or related term (e.g., protagonist, key player, eponymous character) when mentioning it again.

Note: If a user adds multiple pieces of AI-generated content in separate edits, this tell may not apply, as each piece of text may have been generated in isolation.

> Vierny, after a visit in Moscow in the early 1970’s, committed to supporting artists resisting the constraints of socialist realism and discovered Yankilevskly, among others such as Ilya Kabakov and Erik Bulatov. In the challenging climate of Soviet artistic constraints, Yankilevsky, alongside other non-conformist artists, faced obstacles in expressing their creativity freely. Dina Vierny, recognizing the immense talent and the struggle these artists endured, played a pivotal role in aiding their artistic aspirations. \[...\]
> 
> In this new chapter of his life, Yankilevsky found himself amidst a community of like-minded artists who, despite diverse styles, shared a common goal—to break free from the confines of state-imposed artistic norms, particularly socialist realism. \[...\]
> 
> The move to Paris facilitated an environment where Yankilevsky could further explore and exhibit his distinctive artistic vision without the constraints imposed by the Soviet regime. Dina Vierny's unwavering support and commitment to the Russian avant-garde artists played a crucial role in fostering a space where their creativity could flourish, contributing to the rich tapestry of artistic expression in the vibrant cultural landscape of Paris. Vierny's commitment culminated in the groundbreaking exhibition "Russian Avant-Garde - Moscow 1973" at her Saint-Germain-des-Prés gallery, showcasing the diverse yet united front of non-conformist artists challenging the artistic norms of their time.

When from ... to ... constructions are not used figuratively, they are used to indicate the lower and upper bounds of a scale. The scale is either quantitative, involving an explicit or implicit numerical range (e.g. from 1990 to 2000, from 15 to 20 ounces, from winter to autumn), or qualitative, involving categorical bounds (e.g. "from seed to tree", "from mild to severe", "from white belt to black belt"). The same constructions may be used to form a [merism](/wiki/Merism "Merism")—a figure of speech that combines the two extremes as two contrasting parts of the whole to refer to the whole. This is a figurative meaning, but it has the same structure as the non-figurative usage, because it still requires an identifiable scale: from head to toe (the length of a body denoting the whole body), [from soup to nuts](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/from_soup_to_nuts "wikt:from soup to nuts") (clearly based on time), etc. This is _not_ a false range.

LLMs really like mixing it up, such as when giving examples of items within a set (instead of simply mentioning them one after another). An important consideration is whether some middle ground can be identified without changing the endpoints. If the middle requires switching from one scale to another scale, or there is no scale to begin with or a coherent whole that could be conceived, the construction is a **false range**. LLMs often employ "figurative" (often simply: meaningless) "from ... to ..." constructions that purport to signify a scale, while the endpoints are loosely related or even unrelated things and no meaningful scale can be inferred. LLMs do this because such meaningless language is used in persuasive writing to impress and woo, and LLMs are heavily influenced by examples of persuasive writing during their training.

One of their tendencies, inherited from [readmes](/wiki/Readme "Readme"), fan wikis, how-tos, sales pitches, slide decks, listicles and other materials that heavily use boldface, is to emphasize every instance of a chosen word or phrase, often in a "key takeaways" fashion. Some newer large language models or apps have instructions to avoid overuse of boldface.

Ordered lists (i.e. numbered lists) may use explicit numbers (such as `1.`) instead of standard wikitext. When [copied as bare text appearing on the screen](/wiki/Wikipedia:SCOPY "Wikipedia:SCOPY"), some of the formatting information is lost, and line breaks may be lost as well.

While human editors and writers often use [em dashes](/wiki/Em_dash "Em dash") (—), LLM output uses them more often than nonprofessional human-written text of the same genre, and uses them in places where humans are more likely to use commas, parentheses, colons, or (misused) hyphens (-).

This sign is most useful when taken in combination with other indicators, not by itself. It is much more common on discussion pages than in article text. Also, because LLMs' use of em-dashes has become somewhat notorious, some AI companies have attempted to make their newer chatbots suppress their use, most notably OpenAI's [GPT-5.1](/wiki/GPT-5.1 "GPT-5.1").[\[15\]](#cite_note-edwards-21)

ChatGPT and [DeepSeek](/wiki/DeepSeek "DeepSeek") typically use curly quotation marks (“...” or ‘...’) instead of straight quotation marks ("..." or '...'). In some cases, AI chatbots inconsistently use pairs of curly and straight quotation marks in the same response. They also tend to use the curly apostrophe (’), the same character as the curly [right single quotation mark](/wiki/Right_single_quotation_mark "Right single quotation mark"), instead of the straight apostrophe ('), such as in [contractions](/wiki/Contraction_\(grammar\) "Contraction (grammar)") and [possessive forms](/wiki/English_possessive "English possessive"). They may also do this inconsistently.

Curly quotes alone do not prove LLM use. [Microsoft Word](/wiki/Microsoft_Word "Microsoft Word") as well as [macOS](/wiki/MacOS "MacOS") and [iOS](/wiki/IOS "IOS") devices have a "[smart quotes](/wiki/Smart_quotes "Smart quotes")" feature that converts straight quotes to curly quotes. Grammar correcting tools such as [LanguageTool](/wiki/LanguageTool "LanguageTool") may also have such a feature. Curly quotation marks and apostrophes are common in professionally typeset works such as major newspapers. Citation tools like [Citer](https://citer.toolforge.org/) may repeat those that appear in the title of a web page: for example,

Note that Wikipedia allows users to [customize](/wiki/Wikipedia:CUSTOM "Wikipedia:CUSTOM") the fonts used to display text. Some fonts display matched curly apostrophes as straight, in which case the distinction is invisible to the user. Additionally, [Gemini](/wiki/Gemini_\(language_model\) "Gemini (language model)") and [Claude](/wiki/Claude_\(language_model\) "Claude (language model)") models typically do not use curly quotes.

### Skipping heading levels

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Skipping heading levels")\]

AI chatbots tend to skip level 2 headings (`==`, `##` in Markdown) and start sections from the third level (`===`, `###` in Markdown). [Because doing so is against Wikipedia's accessibility and style conventions](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Accessibility#Headings "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility"), it is therefore very unlikely for a manually-formatted page to have this quirk.

Editors sometimes paste text from an AI chatbot that was meant as correspondence, prewriting or advice, rather than article content. This may appear in article text or within comments (<-- -->). Chatbots prompted to produce a Wikipedia article or comment may also explicitly state that the text is meant for Wikipedia, and may mention various [policies and guidelines](/wiki/Wikipedia:PG "Wikipedia:PG") in the output—often explicitly specifying that they're _Wikipedia_'s conventions.

A knowledge-cutoff disclaimer is a statement used by the AI chatbot to indicate that the information provided may be incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated.

If an LLM has a fixed [knowledge cutoff](/wiki/Knowledge_cutoff "Knowledge cutoff") (usually the model's last training update), it is unable to provide any information on events or developments past that time, and it often outputs a disclaimer to remind the user of this cutoff, which usually takes the form of a statement that says the information provided is accurate only up to a certain date.

If an LLM with [retrieval-augmented generation](/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation "Retrieval-augmented generation") fails to find sources on a given topic, or if information is not included in sources a user provides, it often outputs a statement to that effect, which is similar to a knowledge-cutoff disclaimer. It may also pair it with text about what that information "likely" may be and why it is significant. This information is entirely [speculative](/wiki/Wikipedia:OR "Wikipedia:OR") (including the very claim that it's "not documented") and may be based on loosely related topics or completely fabricated. When that unknown information is about an individual's personal life, this disclaimer often claims that the person "maintains a low profile," "keeps personal details private," etc. This is also speculative.

## Markup

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=37 "Edit section: Markup")\]

### Use of Markdown

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=38 "Edit section: Use of Markdown")\]

[Shortcut](/wiki/Wikipedia:Shortcut "Wikipedia:Shortcut")

-   [WP:MARKDOWN](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:MARKDOWN&redirect=no)[WP:MARKDOWN](/wiki/Wikipedia:MARKDOWN "Wikipedia:MARKDOWN")

[Wikitext](/wiki/H:WT "H:WT") is the [markup language](/wiki/Markup_language "Markup language") used to instruct Wikipedia's [MediaWiki](/wiki/MediaWiki "MediaWiki") software how to format an article. While chatbots can be prompted to use wikitext proficiently by experienced chatbot users who know what they are doing, the chatbots generally don't use it, and favor [Markdown](/wiki/Markdown "Markdown") instead. In chatbot apps, the output display is formatted with Markdown, a markup language conceptually similar to wikitext but much more widely applied. Meanwhile, the chatbots' preprompts typically instruct them to use markdown in their answers, such as when providing lists and writing with headings. That is, their system-level instructions often direct them to format outputs using Markdown, and the chatbot apps render its syntax as formatted text on a user's screen. For example, the system prompt for Claude Sonnet 3.5 (November 2024) includes:[\[16\]](#cite_note-sonnetprompt-23)

> Claude uses Markdown formatting. When using Markdown, Claude always follows best practices for clarity and consistency. It always uses a single space after hash symbols for headers (e.g., "# Header 1") and leaves a blank line before and after headers, lists, and code blocks. For emphasis, Claude uses asterisks or underscores consistently (e.g., italic or bold). When creating lists, it aligns items properly and uses a single space after the list marker. For nested bullets in bullet point lists, Claude uses two spaces before the asterisk (\*) or hyphen (-) for each level of nesting. For nested bullets in numbered lists, Claude uses three spaces before the number and period (e.g., "1.") for each level of nesting.

As the above indicates, Markdown syntax is completely different from wikitext. Markdown uses asterisks (\*) or underscores (\_) instead of single-quotes (') for bold and italic formatting, hash symbols (#) instead of equals signs (=) for section headings, parentheses (()) instead of square brackets (\[\]) around URLs, and three symbols (---, \*\*\*, or \_\_\_) instead of four hyphens (----) for thematic breaks.

When told to "generate an article", chatbots often default to using Markdown for the generated output. This formatting is preserved in clipboard text by the copy functions on some chatbot platforms. If instructed to generate content for Wikipedia, the chatbot might "realize" the need to generate Wikipedia-compatible code, and might include a message like Would you like me to ... turn this into actual Wikipedia markup format (\`wikitext\`)?[\[d\]](#cite_note-24) in its output. If the chatbot is told to proceed, the resulting syntax is often rudimentary, syntactically incorrect, or both. The chatbot might put its attempted-wikitext content in a Markdown-style [fenced code block](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) (its syntax for [WP:PRE](/wiki/Wikipedia:PRE "Wikipedia:PRE")) surrounded by Markdown-based syntax and content, which may also be preserved by platform-specific copy-to-clipboard functions, leading to a telling footprint of both markup languages' syntax. This might include the appearance of three backticks in the text, such as: ` ```wikitext `.[\[e\]](#cite_note-25)

The presence of faulty wikitext syntax mixed with Markdown syntax is a strong indicator that content is LLM-generated, especially if in the form of a fenced Markdown code block. However, Markdown _alone_ is not such a strong indicator. Software developers, researchers, technical writers, and experienced internet users frequently use Markdown in tools like [Obsidian](/wiki/Obsidian_\(software\) "Obsidian (software)") and [GitHub](/wiki/GitHub_Flavored_Markdown "GitHub Flavored Markdown"), and on platforms like [Reddit](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043033952-Formatting-Guide), [Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline), and [Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages). Some writing tools and apps, such as [iOS Notes](/wiki/IOS_Notes "IOS Notes"), [Google Docs](/wiki/Google_Docs "Google Docs"), and [Windows Notepad](/wiki/Windows_Notepad "Windows Notepad"), support Markdown editing or exporting. The increasing ubiquity of Markdown may also lead new editors to expect or assume Wikipedia to support Markdown by default.

### Broken wikitext

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=39 "Edit section: Broken wikitext")\]

Since AI chatbots are typically not proficient in wikitext and templates, they often produce faulty syntax. A noteworthy instance is garbled code related to [Template:AfC submission](/wiki/Template:AfC_submission "Template:AfC submission"), as new editors might ask a chatbot how to submit their [Articles for Creation](/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_Creation "Wikipedia:Articles for Creation") draft; see [this discussion among AfC reviewers](/wiki/Special:PermanentLink/1299830745#Messed_up_templates "Special:PermanentLink/1299830745").

### turn0search0

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=40 "Edit section: turn0search0")\]

ChatGPT may include `citeturn0search0` (surrounded by Unicode points in the [Private Use Area](/wiki/Private_Use_Area "Private Use Area")) at the ends of sentences, with the number after "search" increasing as the text progresses. There also exists an alternate shorter form with only the increasing number surrounded by PUA Unicode like `0`. These are places where the chatbot links to an external site, but a human pasting the conversation into Wikipedia has that link converted into placeholder code. This was first observed in February 2025.

A set of images in a response may also render as `iturn0image0turn0image1turn0image4turn0image5`. Rarely, other markup of a similar style, such as `citeturn0news0` ([example](/wiki/Special:PermanentLink/1276934509 "Special:PermanentLink/1276934509")), `citeturn1file0` ([example](/wiki/Special:PermanentLink/1286349902 "Special:PermanentLink/1286349902")), or `cite_generated-reference-identifier_` ([example](/wiki/Special:PermanentLink/1276907078 "Special:PermanentLink/1276907078")), may appear.

### Non-existent or out-of-place categories

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=45 "Edit section: Non-existent or out-of-place categories")\]

[Shortcut](/wiki/Wikipedia:Shortcut "Wikipedia:Shortcut")

-   [WP:AIREDCAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:AIREDCAT&redirect=no)[WP:AIREDCAT](/wiki/Wikipedia:AIREDCAT "Wikipedia:AIREDCAT")

LLMs may hallucinate non-existent categories, sometimes for generic concepts that _seem like_ plausible category titles (or [SEO](/wiki/Search_engine_optimization "Search engine optimization") keywords), and sometimes because their training set includes obsolete and renamed categories. These will appear as [red links](/wiki/Wikipedia:REDNOT "Wikipedia:REDNOT"). You may also find category redirects, such as the longtime spammer favorite [Category:Entrepreneurs](/wiki/Category:Entrepreneurs "Category:Entrepreneurs"). Sometimes, broken categories may be deleted by reviewers, so if you suspect a page may be LLM-generated, it may be worth checking earlier revisions.

Of course, none of this section should be treated as a hard-and-fast rule. New users are unlikely to know about Wikipedia's style guidelines for these sections, and returning editors may be used to old categories that have since been deleted.

> \[\[Category:American hip hop musicians\]\]

> \[\[Category:American hip-hop musicians\]\]

### Non-existent templates

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=46 "Edit section: Non-existent templates")\]

LLMs often hallucinate non-existent templates (especially plausible-sounding types of [infoboxes](/wiki/Wikipedia:Infoboxes "Wikipedia:Infoboxes")) and template parameters. These will also appear as red links, and non-existent template parameters in existing templates have no effect. LLMs may also use templates that were deleted after their knowledge cutoff date.

**Examples**

> {{Infobox ancient population
> | name \= Gangetic Hunter-Gatherer (GHG)

## Citations

### Broken external links

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=48 "Edit section: Broken external links")\]

If a new article or draft has multiple citations with external links, and several of them are broken (e.g., returning [404 errors](/wiki/404_error "404 error")), this is a strong sign of an AI-generated page, particularly if the dead links are not found in website archiving sites like [Internet Archive](/wiki/Internet_Archive "Internet Archive") or [Archive Today](/wiki/Archive_Today "Archive Today"). Most links [become broken over time](/wiki/Link_rot "Link rot"), but these factors make it unlikely that the link was ever real.

### Invalid DOI and ISBNs

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=49 "Edit section: Invalid DOI and ISBNs")\]

For non-AI-specific guidance about DOI and ISBNs, see [Wikipedia:DOI](/wiki/Wikipedia:DOI "Wikipedia:DOI") and [Wikipedia:ISBN](/wiki/Wikipedia:ISBN "Wikipedia:ISBN").

A [checksum](/wiki/Checksum "Checksum") can be used to verify [ISBNs](/wiki/ISBN "ISBN"). An invalid checksum is a very likely sign that an ISBN is incorrect, and citation templates display [a warning](/wiki/Help:CS1_errors#bad_isbn "Help:CS1 errors") if so. Similarly, [DOIs](/wiki/Digital_object_identifier "Digital object identifier") are more resistant to link rot than regular hyperlinks. Unresolvable DOIs and invalid ISBNs can be indicators of [hallucinated](/wiki/Hallucination_\(AI\) "Hallucination (AI)") references.

### Outdated _access-date_s

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=50 "Edit section: Outdated access-dates")\]

In some AI-assisted text, citations may include an _access-date_ by default, but the date can look unexpectedly old relative to when the edit was made (for example, an article created in December 2025 containing multiple citations with `|access-date=12 December 2024`). If a large number of citations share the same old _access-date_ this can be a sign of AI-assisted text. This is not proof by itself, but it can be a useful _pattern to check_ when combined with other signs of low-quality drafting. Note that older _access-date_ values can occur legitimately (copied citations, offline work, batch moves/merges).

### DOIs that lead to unrelated articles

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=51 "Edit section: DOIs that lead to unrelated articles")\]

A LLM may generate references to non-existent scholarly articles with DOIs that appear valid but are, in reality, assigned to unrelated articles. Example passage generated by ChatGPT:

> Ohm’s Law applies to many materials and components that are "ohmic," meaning their resistance remains constant regardless of the applied voltage or current. However, it does not hold for non-linear devices like diodes or transistors \[1\]\[2\].
> 
> 1\. M. E. Van Valkenburg, “The validity and limitations of Ohm’s law in non-linear circuits,” Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 62, no. 6, pp. 769–770, Jun. 1974. [doi](/wiki/Doi_\(identifier\) "Doi (identifier)"):[10.1109/PROC.1974.9547](https://doi.org/10.1109%2FPROC.1974.9547)
> 
> 2\. C. L. Fortescue, “Ohm’s Law in alternating current circuits,” Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 55, no. 11, pp. 1934–1936, Nov. 1967. [doi](/wiki/Doi_\(identifier\) "Doi (identifier)"):[10.1109/PROC.1967.6033](https://doi.org/10.1109%2FPROC.1967.6033)

Both _Proceedings of the IEEE_ citations are completely made up. The DOIs lead to different citations and have other problems as well. For instance, [C. L. Fortescue](/wiki/Charles_LeGeyt_Fortescue "Charles LeGeyt Fortescue") was dead for 30+ years at the purported time of writing, and [Vol 55, Issue 11](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31102&punumber=5) does not list any articles that match anything remotely close to the information given in reference 2.

### Book citations without page numbers or URLs

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=52 "Edit section: Book citations without page numbers or URLs")\]

LLMs often generate book citations that do not include page numbers. This passage, for example, was generated by ChatGPT:

> Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in the field of electrical engineering and physics that states the current passing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, provided the temperature remains constant. Mathematically, it is expressed as V=IR, where V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance. The law was formulated by German physicist Georg Simon Ohm in 1827, and it serves as a cornerstone in the analysis and design of electrical circuits \[1\].
> 
> 1\. Dorf, R. C., & Svoboda, J. A. (2010). Introduction to Electric Circuits (8th ed.). Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons. [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN_\(identifier\) "ISBN (identifier)") [9780470521571](/wiki/Special:BookSources/9780470521571 "Special:BookSources/9780470521571").

The book reference appears valid – a book on electric circuits would likely have information about Ohm's law – but without the page number, that citation is not useful for verifying the claims in the prose.

Some LLM-generated book citations include page numbers, and the book exists, but the cited pages do not verify the text. Signs to look out for: the book is on a somewhat general topic or frequently referenced in its field, and the citation does not include a URL (not mandatory for book citations, but editors creating legitimate book citations often include a link to [an online version of the text](/wiki/Wikipedia:Book_sources#Online_text "Wikipedia:Book sources")). Example:

> Analysts note that traditionalists often appeal to prudence, stability, and Edmund Burke’s notion of “prescription,” while reactionaries invoke moral urgency and cultural emergency, framing the present as a deviation from an idealized past. \[1\]
> 
> 1\. Goldwater, Barry (1960). The Conscience of a Conservative. Victor Publishing. p. 12.

This may look like a reasonable citation, but searching an [online version of the book for "Burke" produces no results](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Conscience_of_a_Conservative/PKd_EQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=burke).

### Incorrect or unconventional use of references

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=53 "Edit section: Incorrect or unconventional use of references")\]

[Shortcut](/wiki/Wikipedia:Shortcut "Wikipedia:Shortcut")

-   [WP:AICITESTYLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:AICITESTYLE&redirect=no)[WP:AICITESTYLE](/wiki/Wikipedia:AICITESTYLE "Wikipedia:AICITESTYLE")

AI tools may have been prompted to include references, and make an attempt to do so as Wikipedia expects, but fail with some key implementation details or stand out when compared with conventions.

**Examples**

In the below example, note the incorrect attempt at re-using references. The tool used here was not capable of searching for non-confabulated sources (as it was done the day before Bing Deep Search launched) but nonetheless found one real reference. The syntax for re-using the references was incorrect.

In this case, the _Smith, R. J._ source – being the "third source" the tool presumably generated the link '[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3'](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3') (which has a PMID reference of 3) – is also completely irrelevant to the body of the article. The user did not check the reference before they converted it to a {{[cite journal](/wiki/Template:Cite_journal "Template:Cite journal")}} reference, even though the links resolve.

The LLM in this case has diligently included the incorrect re-use syntax after every single full stop.

### utm\_source=

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=54 "Edit section: utm_source=")\]

ChatGPT may add the [UTM parameters](/wiki/UTM_parameter "UTM parameter") `utm_source=openai` or `utm_source=chatgpt.com` to URLs that it is using as sources. Microsoft Copilot may add `utm_source=copilot.com` to URLs. Grok uses `referrer=grok.com`. Other LLMs, such as Gemini or Claude, use UTM parameters less often.[\[f\]](#cite_note-27)

Note: While this does definitively prove ChatGPT's involvement, it doesn't prove, on its own, that ChatGPT also generated the writing. Some editors use AI tools to find citations for existing text; this will be apparent in the edit history.

### Sudden shift in writing style

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=59 "Edit section: Sudden shift in writing style")\]

A sudden shift in an editor's writing style, such as unexpectedly flawless grammar compared to their other communication, may indicate the use of AI tools. Combining formal and casual writing styles is not exclusive to AI, but may be considered a sign. Using more formal prose in some writing may simply be a matter of code switching.

A mismatch of user location, national ties of the topic to a variety of English, and the variety of English used may indicate the use of AI tools. A human writer from India writing about an Indian university would probably not use American English; however, LLM outputs use American English by default, unless prompted otherwise.[\[18\]](#cite_note-Ju_et_al.-28) Note that non-native English speakers tend to mix up English varieties, and such signs should raise suspicion only if there is a sudden and complete shift in an editor's English variety use.

### Overwhelmingly verbose edit summaries

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=60 "Edit section: Overwhelmingly verbose edit summaries")\]

AI-generated [edit summaries](/wiki/Help:Edit_summary "Help:Edit summary") are often unusually long, written as formal, first-person paragraphs without [abbreviations](/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_summary_legend "Wikipedia:Edit summary legend"), and/or conspicuously itemize Wikipedia's conventions.

### "Submission statements" in AFC drafts

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=61 "Edit section: \"Submission statements\" in AFC drafts")\]

This one is specific to drafts submitted by [Articles for Creation](/wiki/Wikipedia:AFC "Wikipedia:AFC"). At least one LLM tends to insert "submission statements" supposedly intended for reviewers that supposedly explain why the subject is notable and why the draft meets Wikipedia guidelines. Of course, [all this actually does is](/wiki/Wikipedia:BOOMERANG "Wikipedia:BOOMERANG") let reviewers know that the draft is LLM-generated, and should be declined or speedied without a second thought.

> Reviewer note (for AfC): This draft is a neutral and well-sourced biography of Portuguese public manager Jorge Patrão. All references are from independent, reliable sources (Público, Diário de Notícias, Jornal de Negócios, RTP, O Interior, Agência Lusa) covering his public career and cultural activity. It meets WP:RS and WP:BLP standards and demonstrates clear notability per WP:NBIO through: – Presidency of Serra da Estrela Tourism Region (1998–2013); – Presidency of Parkurbis – Covilhã Science and Technology Park; – Founding role in Rede de Judiarias de Portugal (member of the Council of Europe’s European Routes of Jewish Heritage); – Authorship of the book "1677 – A Fábrica d’El-Rei"; – Founder/curator of the Beatriz de Luna Art Collection (Old Master focus).

### Pre-placed maintenance templates

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=62 "Edit section: Pre-placed maintenance templates")\]

Occasionally a new editor creates a draft that includes an [AFC](/wiki/Wikipedia:AFC "Wikipedia:AFC") review template already set to "declined". The template is also devoid of content with no reviewer reasoning given. The LLM apparently offers to add an AFC submission template to the draft, and then provides something like `{{[AfC submission](/wiki/Template:AfC_submission "Template:AfC submission")|d}}`, in which the "d" parameter pre-declines the draft by substituting {{[AfC submission/declined](/wiki/Template:AfC_submission/declined "Template:AfC submission/declined")}}. The draft's contribution history reveals that this template was inserted at some point by the draft's creator. Invariably the creator then asks on [Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Help desk](/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Articles_for_creation/Help_desk "Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Help desk") or one of the other help pages why the draft was declined with no feedback. The presence of a content-free "submission declined" header is a **strong** indicator that the draft was LLM-generated.

LLMs have been known to create pages that already have maintenance templates that shouldn't plausibly be there, including maintenance tags and incorrect [protection](/wiki/Wikipedia:Protection "Wikipedia:Protection") templates.

## Signs of human writing

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=63 "Edit section: Signs of human writing")\]

### Age of text relative to ChatGPT launch

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=64 "Edit section: Age of text relative to ChatGPT launch")\]

ChatGPT was launched to the public on November 30, 2022. Although OpenAI had similarly powerful LLMs before then, they were paid services and not easily accessible or known to lay people. Thus, if an edit was made **before November 30, 2022**, AI use can be safely ruled out for the corresponding text. While some older writing displays some of the AI signs given in this list, and may even convincingly appear to have been AI-generated, the vastness of Wikipedia allows for these coincidences.

### Ability to explain one's own editorial choices

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=65 "Edit section: Ability to explain one's own editorial choices")\]

Editors should be able to explain why they made an edit or mistake. For example, if an editor inserts a URL that appears fabricated, you can ask how the mix-up occurred instead of jumping to conclusions. If they can supply the correct link and explain it as a human error (perhaps a typo), or share the relevant passage from the real source, that points to an ordinary human error.

## Ineffective indicators

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=66 "Edit section: Ineffective indicators")\]

False accusations of AI use can [drive away new editors](/wiki/Wikipedia:BITE "Wikipedia:BITE") and foster an atmosphere of suspicion. Before claiming AI was used, consider whether [Dunning–Kruger effect](/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect "Dunning–Kruger effect") and [confirmation bias](/wiki/Confirmation_bias "Confirmation bias") is clouding your judgement. Here are several somewhat commonly used indicators that are ineffective in LLM detection—and may even indicate the opposite.

-   **Perfect grammar**: While modern LLMs are known for high grammatical proficiency, many editors are also skilled writers or come from professional writing backgrounds. (See also [§ Sudden shift in English variety use](#Sudden_shift_in_English_variety_use).)

-   **Combination of casual and formal registers, or language that sounds both "clinical" and "emotional"**: This may indicate the casual writing of a person in a technical field, such as computer science. It may also indicate youth, a preference for mixed registers, playfulness, or neurodivergence. Or it may simply be the result of multiple editors adding to a page.

-   **"Bland" or "robotic" prose**: LLM output has specific traits, as detailed above, and it skews positive and verbose by default. While these tendencies are formulaic, they may not scan as "robotic" to those unfamiliar with AI writing.[\[19\]](#cite_note-jalt-29)

-   **"Fancy," "academic," or "formal" prose**: While LLMs disproportionately favor certain words and phrases, many of which are longer and have more difficult [readability](/wiki/Readability "Readability") scores than some of their synonyms, these are _specific words_. The correlation does not extend to all formal, academic, or "fancy"-sounding prose.[\[1\]](#cite_note-Russell-2)

-   **Letter-like writing (in isolation)**: Although many talk page messages written with [salutations](/wiki/Salutation "Salutation"), [valedictions](/wiki/Valediction "Valediction"), [subject lines](/wiki/Wikipedia:SUBJECTLINE "Wikipedia:SUBJECTLINE"), and other formalities after 2023 tend to appear AI-generated, letters and emails have conventionally been written in such ways _long_ before modern LLMs existed. Human editors (particularly newer editors) may format their talk page comments similarly for various reasons, such as being more accustomed to formal communication, posting as part of a school assignment that requires this tone, or simply mistaking the talk page for email. Other tells, such as [vertical lists](#Inline-header_vertical_lists)[\[g\]](#cite_note-30), [placeholders](#Phrasal_templates_and_placeholder_text), or [abrupt cutoffs](#Abrupt_cut_offs), are stronger.

-   **Transition words (in isolation)**: Older AI text tended to formulaically overuse certain [transitions](/wiki/Transition_\(linguistics\) "Transition (linguistics)") like _Additionally,_ _Consequently,_ and _Notably,_ often to begin sentences. However, only a few transition words and phrases are known to be overused by AI in this way. This pattern also has precedence in essay-like writing by humans and is accepted by many style guides, so this is not a strong tell.

-   **Unsourced content**: [More than 570,000 articles](/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements "Category:All articles with unsourced statements") are tagged as needing citations, and most of them predate LLMs. Meanwhile, since modern LLM chatbots can search the web and/or view sources a user provides to it, citations are fairly common now in AI-generated text. This does not mean they are _accurate_ citations, but they are there. Chatbots are known to hallucinate bogus citations, so if there are strong suspicions a chatbot created some of the content, check the references to see if they actually exist.

-   **Bizarre [wikitext](/wiki/Help:Wikitext "Help:Wikitext")**: While LLMs may hallucinate templates or generate wikitext code with invalid syntax for reasons explained in [§ Use of Markdown](#Use_of_Markdown), they are not likely to generate content with certain random-seeming, "inexplicable" errors and artifacts (excluding the ones listed here in [§ Markup](#Markup)). Bizarrely placed [HTML tags](/wiki/HTML_tags "HTML tags") like <span> are more indicative of poorly programmed browser extensions or a known bug with Wikipedia's content translation tool ([T113137](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T113137 "phabricator:T113137")). Misplaced syntax like `''Catch-22 i''s a satirical novel.` (rendered as "_Catch-22 i_s a satirical novel.") are more indicative of mistakes in [VisualEditor](/wiki/Wikipedia:VisualEditor "Wikipedia:VisualEditor"), where such errors are harder to notice than in [source editing](/wiki/Wikipedia:Source_editing "Wikipedia:Source editing").

## Historical indicators

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=67 "Edit section: Historical indicators")\]

The following indicators were common in text generated by older AI models, but are much less frequent in newer models. They may still be useful for finding older undetected AI-generated edits. Dates are approximate.

### Didactic disclaimers (2022–2024)

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=68 "Edit section: Didactic disclaimers (2022–2024)")\]

For non-AI-specific guidance about this, see [Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch § Editorializing](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Editorializing "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch").

Words to watch: **_it's important/critical/crucial to note/remember/consider_, _worth noting_, _may vary_...**

Older LLMs (~2023) often added disclaimers about topics being "important to note".[\[20\]](#cite_note-speroemiprimary-31) This frequently took the form of advice to an imagined reader regarding safety or controversial topics, or disambiguating topics that varied in different locales/jurisdictions. Several such disclaimers appear in OpenAI's GPT-4 system card as examples of "partial refusals".[\[21\]](#cite_note-openaicdn-32)

**Examples**

> The emergence of these informal groups reflects a growing recognition of the interconnected nature of urban issues and the potential for ANCs to play a role in shaping citywide policies. However, it's important to note that these caucuses operate outside the formal ANC structure and their influence on policy decisions may vary.

> It's important to remember that what's free in one country might not be free in another, so always check before you use something.

### Section summaries

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=69 "Edit section: Section summaries")\]

[Shortcuts](/wiki/Wikipedia:Shortcut "Wikipedia:Shortcut")

-   [WP:CONCLUSION](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:CONCLUSION&redirect=no)[WP:CONCLUSION](/wiki/Wikipedia:CONCLUSION "Wikipedia:CONCLUSION")
-   [WP:INCONCLUSION](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:INCONCLUSION&redirect=no)[WP:INCONCLUSION](/wiki/Wikipedia:INCONCLUSION "Wikipedia:INCONCLUSION")

Words to watch: **_In summary_, _In conclusion_, _Overall_ ...**

When generating longer outputs (such as when told to "write an article"), older LLMs often added sections titled "Conclusion" or similar, and often ended paragraphs or sections by summarizing and restating its core idea.[\[18\]](#cite_note-Ju_et_al.-28)

**Examples**

> In summary, the educational and training trajectory for nurse scientists typically involves a progression from a master's degree in nursing to a Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing, followed by postdoctoral training in nursing research. This structured pathway ensures that nurse scientists acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to engage in rigorous research and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of nursing science.

— From [this revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=&diff=1188230584&oldid=) in [Nurse scientist](/wiki/Nurse_scientist "Nurse scientist")

### Prompt refusal

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=70 "Edit section: Prompt refusal")\]

Words to watch: **_as an AI language model_, _as a large language model_, _I cannot offer medical advice, but I can..._, _I'm sorry_ ...**

In the past, AI chatbots occasionally declined to answer prompts as written, usually with apologies and reminders that they are AI language models. Attempting to be helpful, chatbots often gave suggestions or answers to alternative, similar requests. Outright refusals have become increasingly rare.

**Examples**

> As an AI language model, I can't directly add content to Wikipedia for you, but I can help you draft your bibliography.

— From [this revision](/wiki/Special:Diff/1221340799 "Special:Diff/1221340799") to [Parmiter's Almshouse & Pension Charity](/wiki/Parmiter%27s_Almshouse_%26_Pension_Charity "Parmiter's Almshouse & Pension Charity")

### Abrupt cut offs

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=71 "Edit section: Abrupt cut offs")\]

AI tools used to abruptly stop generating content if an excessive number of tokens had been used for a single response, and further responses required the user to select "continue generating", at least in the case of ChatGPT.

This method is not foolproof, as a malformed copy/paste from one's local computer can also cause this. It may also indicate a [copyright violation](/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyvio "Wikipedia:Copyvio") rather than the use of an LLM.

## Notes

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing&action=edit&section=73 "Edit section: Notes")\]

1.  **[^](#cite_ref-1 "Jump up")** Specifically, this guide is somewhat less useful for texts which are not "dry academic" writing. For example, the many tells specific to fiction (whispering woods, [Elara Voss](https://maxread.substack.com/p/who-is-elara-voss), etc.) are less relevant in Wikipedia and so they are not listed here.
2.  **[^](#cite_ref-4 "Jump up")** This can be directly observed by examining images generated by [text-to-image models](/wiki/Text-to-image_model "Text-to-image model"); they look acceptable at first glance, but specific details tend to be blurry and malformed.
